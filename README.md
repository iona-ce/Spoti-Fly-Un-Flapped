# Spoti-Fly-Un-Flapped
Short script to find out which birds I have seen the most frequently in 2022, based on my eBird data.

I created this code to figure out my "Spoti-Fly Un-Flapped", inspired by Spotify's annual "Spotify Unwrapped", which summarises the music/podcasts 
that you have listened to in the last year. I thought this would be fun for birds as well.

This script also removes subspecies data e.g. Long-tailed Tit (europaeus Group), but this step can be skipped.
