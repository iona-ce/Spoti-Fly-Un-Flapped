# Spoti-Fly-Un-Flapped
Short script to find out which birds I have seen the most frequently in 2022, based on my eBird data, in terms of number of checklists. 

I wrote this code to figure out my "Spoti-Fly Un-Flapped", inspired by Spotify's annual "Spotify Unwrapped", which summarises the music/podcasts 
that you have listened to in the last year. I thought this would be fun for birds as well: what species have I recorded the most frequently in 2022 based on the number of eBird checklists I have reported them in?.

This script additionally removes subspecies data e.g. "Long-tailed Tit (europaeus Group)" to simply "Long-tailed tit", but this can be skipped if it is not needed. 

The outputs are:
- Frequency table for each species, i.e. the number of checklists in which each has been reported.
- A histogram of frequency data.
